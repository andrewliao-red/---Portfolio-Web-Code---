This is the code I have written up for my personal portfolio website. The layout is simple, fixed and straight to the point. 
This website is where I show my Graphic Design work, along with many other design/art-related projects I have created these past years. 
My aim is to continue working upon this website and hopefully, this website will become something of a project itself that I create.
A lot of work has been put into this project, as I have been using self-taught coding to build this website.
